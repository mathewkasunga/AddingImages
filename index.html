    <h1 class="blog">Nasir Jones Better Known as NAS</h1> <!-- first-level heading -->    

    <h2>About Nas</h2>
    <p>
      Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones; born September 14, 1973), better known by his stage name Nas, is an American rapper. 
      Rooted in East Coast hip hop, he is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. The son of jazz musician Olu Dara, 
      Jones began his musical career in 1989 as he adopted the moniker of "Nasty Nas". 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas's debut album, Illmatic (1994), received universal acclaim upon release and is considered to be one of the greatest hip hop 
      albums of all time. In 2020, the album was inducted into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry. His second
      album It Was Written (1996) debuted atop the Billboard 200. 
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2001 to 2005, Nas was involved in a highly publicized feud with Jay-Z, popularized by the diss track "Ether". It was this feud, 
      along with Nas's albums Stillmatic (2001), God's Son (2002), and the double album Street's Disciple (2004), that helped restore his 
      critical standing.

    <h2>Artistry</h2>
    <p>
      Nas has been praised for his ability to create a "devastating match between lyrics and production" by journalist Peter Shapiro, 
      as well as creating a "potent evocation of life on the street," and he has even been compared to Rakim for his lyrical technique. 
      In his book "Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop" (2009), writer Adam Bradley states, "Nas is perhaps contemporary rap's greatest 
      innovator in storytelling."
    </p>
    <p>
      His catalog includes songs narrated before birth ('Fetus') and after death ('Amongst Kings'), biographies ('UBR [Unauthorized Biography of Rakim]') 
      and autobiographies ('Doo Rags'), allegorical tales and epistolary ones ('One Love'). He's rapped in the voice of a woman 
      ('Sekou Story') and even of a gun ('I Gave You Power').
    </p>
    <p>
      On November 12, 2019, Nas was honored by Haute Living, along with Watches of Switzerland and Hennessy, in a celebratory affair 
      that included a violin rendition of iconic Nas songs performed by Edward W. Hardy. Nas is a fan of his hometown baseball team, the 
      New York Mets, and English soccer team Everton FC.
